# `LeaderboardComponent` Documentation

## Overview

The `LeaderboardComponent` is responsible for displaying a dynamic leaderboard of players, showing their rank, summoner name, profile icon, most played champion, MMR, games played, win rate, KDA, and other relevant statistics. It provides a visual representation of player performance and allows users to refresh the data.

## Structure

This component consists of:

* **Template (`leaderboard.html`)**: Defines the HTML structure for the leaderboard, including the header, a refresh button, and the table for player data. It uses Angular's structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) to dynamically render player rows and handle different states (loading, error, data available).
* **Styles (`leaderboard.scss`)**: Provides the styling for the leaderboard, defining the layout, colors, typography, and responsive adjustments. It includes styles for the overall container, table, individual player rows, and specific columns like rank, player info, champion info, and statistics.
* **Component Logic (`leaderboard.ts`)**: Contains the TypeScript logic for fetching data, managing component state, handling user interactions (like refreshing the leaderboard), and formatting data for display.

## Functionality

1. **Data Fetching and Display**: The component fetches leaderboard data (likely from a backend service) and displays it in a tabular format. It handles loading states and potential errors during data retrieval.
2. **Player Statistics**: Each row represents a player and shows:
    * Rank
    * Profile Icon and Summoner Name
    * Most Played Champion (with icon and name)
    * MMR (Matchmaking Rating)
    * Total Games Played
    * Win Rate (calculated from wins and losses)
    * KDA (Kills, Deaths, Assists)
3. **Refresh Mechanism**: A "Refresh" button allows users to manually update the leaderboard data, triggering a new data fetch.
4. **Styling and Responsiveness**: The `leaderboard.scss` file defines a visually appealing layout with a dark theme, gradients, and subtle animations. It uses CSS Grid for the table layout and includes media queries for responsiveness on smaller screens.

## Key Files

* `leaderboard.ts`: The main component file containing the logic.
* `leaderboard.html`: The template file defining the UI structure.
* `leaderboard.scss`: The styling file for the component.

## Styling Details (`leaderboard.scss`)

* **Overall Layout**: Uses flexbox for the main container and header, and CSS Grid for the table layout (`.leaderboard-table`, `.table-header`, `.table-body`).
* **Theming**: Employs a dark background with gold/brown accents (`#c89b3c`, `#f0e6d2`, `#cdbe91`) for text and borders, consistent with a League of Legends theme.
* **Interactivity**: Hover effects on table rows (`.player-row:hover`) provide visual feedback. The refresh button has distinct hover and active states, with a spinning icon animation (`.icon-refresh.spinning`).
* **Typography**: Defines font sizes, weights, and colors for various text elements to ensure readability and hierarchy.
* **Responsive Design**: Includes media queries to adjust the table layout and hide certain columns on smaller screens to maintain usability.
* **Component-specific styles**: Styles for player profile icons, champion icons, progress bars for win rates, and specific column alignments.

## Dependencies

* Likely depends on a service (e.g., `PlayerService` or a dedicated `LeaderboardService`) to fetch player data from the backend.
* Angular core modules for component functionality, data binding, and lifecycle hooks.

## Potential Improvements

* **Pagination/Infinite Scrolling**: For very large leaderboards, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve performance and user experience.
* **Sorting**: Add options to sort the leaderboard by different metrics (MMR, Win Rate, KDA, Games Played).
* **Search/Filter**: Implement search functionality to find specific players or filters to narrow down the leaderboard by criteria (e.g., champion, role).
* **Error Handling UI**: Provide more user-friendly error messages and recovery options if data fetching fails.
* **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility by ensuring proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
* **Performance Optimization**: Review change detection strategies and consider `OnPush` where appropriate to optimize rendering performance for large lists.
